# Re-React

React from scratch. For educational purposes.

Notes about development and learning contained in `/notes`

[Resource used](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) (project is directly made with this book).

*NOTE: the notes are written in JavaScript, but the actual project is written in TypeScript. That shouldn't be an issue but if it is, good luck!*
